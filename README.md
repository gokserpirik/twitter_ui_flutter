# twitha

A basic project I made before when I was learning Flutter(one month ago, I guess). It looks simple and it is simple. Just UI based coding.
I'm putting this in here to let you see my first codes in Flutter. I hope as long as I get better at coding in Flutter this will be my "really old times" at coding.
 
## Getting Started

# twitha

A basic project I made before when I was learning Flutter(one month ago, I guess). It looks simple and it is simple. Just UI based coding.
I'm putting this in here to let you see my first codes in Flutter. I hope as long as I get better at coding in Flutter this will be my "really old times" at coding.
 
## Getting Started

Used  google_fonts: ^2.1.0

Also check assets:
 - lib/img/post.jpg
 - lib/img/oneprofile.jpg

##Samples
Tbh, I didn't try to make every page great. It was my first project try so I only made basics of it.
